## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this challenge I have learned that responsive design can be a big challenge and it is very easy to complicate things if you aren’t careful, which I wasn’t. I used to use absolutely positioning to overlay content but, in this challenge, I used GRID which seemed confusing at first but with grid it was easier to make the site more responsive. I also learned to use flexbox and grid together.

### Continued development

While I used flexbox and grid in this challenge to make the layouts and make them responsive, I still need to learn to use them more efficiently and I need to work on writing and repeating less CSS. I have noticed that I am repeating a lot of the same CSS and complicating simple things. I want to focus on writing CSS more efficiently and use utility and component classes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS GRID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This video on css grid from Kevin Powell was really healful in understanding css grid.
- [overlaping content with css grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFG3BKOqOlE) - This video also from Kevin Powell healped me to understand the concept of overlapping content with css grid.
- [Animated Hamburger Menu Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIyVTjJAkLw) - This video by codeSTACKr is a very good guide on animating a hamgurber menu.
